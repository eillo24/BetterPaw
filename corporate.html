          <p></p>

          <h3>Brand Name</h3>
          <p>The brand name “BetterPaw” consists of two words; ‘Better’ and ‘Paw’. 

 

            ‘Better’, is the word used for wanting your dog to get better, be better, and feel better. It’s the word used where the owner wants to grow together with their pet friend and connect with them and grow a stronger bond with. ‘Better’ is where you overcome the struggles that you and your dog have, in order to live, love, and strive for another day, one paw at a time. ‘Better’ is where not only a dog learns how to better themselves, but where the caregiver also gets taught how to regain control. 
            
             
            
            Whereas ‘Paw’ stands not only for the dog themself, but also lending a helping and loving hand. ‘Paw’ represents the joint efforts of both the owner, the dog, and the hardships they may have carried and continue to battle together. The word ‘Paw’ is about learning together, growing together, overcoming together. It’s a shared experience, where one cannot be without the other. ‘Paw’ is where love is a bond that is so strong that it can overcome anything through time and patience. 
            
             
            
            With this, we created “BetterPaw”, where we provide online training for rescue dogs and their beloved owners. </p>

          <h3>Visual identity</h3>
          <p>BetterPaw’s logo incorporates both the dog, and a human ‘paw’, the hand. This brings it back to the explanation of the brand name, in which we want to return to our values, most prominently love and patience. They’re crucial visions for both of us, dog owners, and their rescue dogs. When looking at our logo, we not only want it to be recognisable, but also a logo that people look at and immediately understand what we stand for.  
 
            The logo of BetterPaw is the base of every visual communication and will be put in every post that is put out, and it is important that we keep the colors of the logo the same as the colors of our palette, in addition to the font of the name, and if necessary, our slogan which is done with the Bilo font. </p>

          <h3>Supporting Visuals</h3>
          <p>Our use of icons is on the softer side. We use round corners, simplistic design and visuals, and keep it calm this way. Paws and bones are used in a playful way (a trail of paws, with the bones used as a complimentary design to accompany it), whereas our buttons are kept simple with purely rounded edges. The social media icons are all rounded and kept quite simple, in order not to overwhelm people. Most of our icon usage are the paws. We use these as dividers and complimentary design with the copy and imagery. </p>
          <p>As for our imagery, we want to capture the values of our brand. Such images have to demonstrate the importance, such as ‘Love’ showcasing the nurturing aspect of being a dog owner and the strong bond they have with their rescue dog. For ‘Patience’, the imagery should reflect the time and effort spent raising and training a dog and showing a supportive and most importantly a controlled environment. ‘Growth’ is an important imagery to capture the real-life situation that happens when being a dog owner, but being able to overcome obstacles together. And lastly, the imagery for ‘Community’ is most important of all, this should showcase the importance of being in a community and feeling understood. For this, BetterPaw uses a lifestyle photography in authentic settings, either at home or outside. The imagery should display the importance of our vision, values, and capture the spirit and energy of BetterPaw. We show real product interaction, positive environments, real life situations that reflect BetterPaw honestly, portray people in thriving and enjoyable situations, and people in bright and natural lighting. We do not show staged interactions or exaggerate effects/poses, nor do we use out-of-focus imagery. Overly conceptual imagery can be used, but in caution depending on what message BetterPaw wants to send. </p>
          <p>BetterPaw also makes great use of artistic visuals, as they are popular in terms of usage in our target group. These visuals showcase both dogs and dog owners, with a focus on the dogs. They are of simplistic design and do not take away from the importance at hand, our message and copy that comes with it. As BetterPaw uses a colorful palette alongside its funky font and core values, it is important that the brand showcases this through visuals as well. Digitally drawn and simple visuals are considered the best option for this. The feeling these visuals evoke are positive and should only be used when sending out a positive message. The visuals themselves should showcase this as well through smiles, playful behaviour, and overall happiness. </p>

          <h3>Copywriting</h3>
          <p>The tone of voice for BetterPaw is friendly and joyful, with a nurturing feel to it. We want others to feel and know that they are seen, understood, and heard. But the tone of voice also has the job of making people feel comfortable, both through our social media content and website alike. BetterPaw wants to tell a story that has personality, and that personality has to match with rescue dog owners. They have a different approach than regular dog owners even though they’re similar. The tone of voice is to be trusting and invite others to engage in a community. Where others say, “Rescue dogs are loving dogs”, we say “Sometimes your better half is on the other side of the world, and you only just realize it now.”. </p>

          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Colour scheme:</strong> Our colors consist of one main color and two secondary ones, besides using both black (#000000) and white (#ffffff). The main color is considered pink (#e63b7a), and the secondary colors are blue (#c3e7f1) and green (#26b56e). These colors are used throughout everything, from the logo to the fonts, imagery, icons, and artistic visuals. We want these colors to be vibrant yet approachable, so that BetterPaw gives off a positive feeling without it feeling manufactured.
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #E63B7A;"></span>
                 <strong>#E63B7A:</strong>  Pink is considered a popular color within our persona (think of “Millenial Pink” for example), and it also represents love, nurture and compassion. It evokes feelings of comfort, warmth and hope. This color is used in our logo and headings, but also important objects and subjects in order to draw the eye to it, such as a button to ‘Log In’ and ‘Giveaway’. As for background use, the color is only used in complement and to give diversity to the main background color, blue.
                  
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #C3E6F0;"></span>
                  <strong>#C3E6F0: </strong> Blue is one of the secondary colors that is mainly used as our official background color. There can be a slight hue to provide more depth, but green and pink should be the main consideration for complimentary design. Blue is represented as serenity, stability, inspiration, or wisdom. It can be a calming color, which is all in line with our vision of BetterPaw providing a sense of stability and control in the world. 
                 
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #00BD6E;"></span>
                  <strong>#00BD6E:</strong> Last but not least, we have our second secondary color, green. This color is used as a complimentary color to both our blue background and our main color, pink. It is often used in our artistic visuals and used to bring depth to our work. The colors represent rebirth and renewal, new beginnings, and growth. In addition to it also being considered youth, nature, and health. This fits in with BetterPaw’s values, especially (and quite literally), growth.
                 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Font choices:</strong> Two fonts are used, the BD Supper font and the Bilo font. Although the BD Supper font is big and loud, it’s still playful in the details. It attracts people but isn’t too serious with it, and it gives the feeling of “Yeah, this really looks like a dog-vibe font”. We use this font for our headings and logo. On the other hand, Bilo is the font we use for the informative text on both the website and social media posts, in addition to the slogan of the brand. This font is calm, collective, and easier to read, allowing the room to breathe. </li>
            
            <p></p>

            <li>Testimonial: We tend to trust online reviews and testimonials as much as recommendations from people we know. Whether testimonials are presented with text, video, or include a picture of the sender’s face, they offer social proof giving your value claims more legitimacy.</li>
            <li>Navigation Tab: Navigation tabs provide a clear visual indication of what content can be found on a website and places the current location in context by highlighting it.</li>
            <li>Carousel (Used for Testimonials): The carousel highlights several different stories on the same screen. It allows users to quickly skim through stories. Carousels capture the user’s attention and retain attention with simple navigation. </li>
            <li>Footer: The hierarchical structure of a website can at times impede the path to specific page or function of a website. By adding a shortcut to the most frequently used pages and functions, the path can be shortened: the number of clicks can be lessened and the confusion decreased.</li>
            <li>Drop-Down Menu (Mobile): Drop-Down Menus save space, this is the main reason for using it.</li>

            <p></p>

            <li><strong>Brand Name:</strong> ‘Better’, is the word used for wanting your dog to get better, be better, and feel better. It’s the word used where the owner wants to grow together with their pet friend and connect with them and grow a stronger bond with. ‘Better’ is where you overcome the struggles that you and your dog have, in order to live, love, and strive for another day, one paw at a time. ‘Better’ is where not only a dog learns how to better themselves, but where the caregiver also gets taught how to regain control.

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Testing Goals:</strong> The objective of this testing protocol is to thoroughly evaluate the functionality, usability, and effectiveness of the website aimed at providing a community platform for rescue dog owners and generating personalized training plans for rescue dogs. The primary focus is to ensure that the website effectively communicates its purpose and meets the needs of the target audience. </li>
            <li><strong>Testing Participants:</strong> For our testing we have chosen two participants, both women who own rescue dogs and are interested in training plans for dogs. </li>
            <li><strong>Testing Setting:</strong> The testing of our brand was done on a laptop, in a quiet environment on the campus. We made sure to have a stable internet connection, comfortable seating arrangements, and quiet surroundings to minimize distractions. 
            <li><strong>Testing Protocol:</strong> Each participant will be briefed on the purpose of the testing and provided with necessary instructions, participants will be asked to perform the assigned tasks while verbalizing their thoughts and actions, observers will record participants' interactions, noting any difficulties, confusion, or positive experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing results</strong> - Positive and negative aspects of the UI/UX that have been identified, ranked by importance.</li>
            <li><strong>Positive Aspects of UI/UX:</strong></li>
            <li>Clear Sign-up/Log-in Process: Testers found the sign-up/log-in process to be straightforward and obvious, indicating good usability.</li>
            <li>Community Engagement: Users appreciated the community feature, finding it easy to access and valuable for seeking support and information from other users.</li>
            <li>Training Plan Access: Testers found it easy to navigate to the personalized training plan section, including accessing the assessment test required for the plan.</li>
            <li>Overall Branding and Design: Users liked the cohesive branding throughout the website, particularly mentioning the paw prints and how it contributes to a unified brand identity.</li>
            <li>Functional Buttons: Testers found the buttons to be noticeable, functional, and well-matched with the overall design and color scheme.</li>
            <li>Social Media and Contact Accessibility: Users appreciated the clear placement of social media links and contact information, making it easy to access.</li>
            <li>Negative Aspects of UI/UX:</li>
            <li>Confusing Navigation: Some users found the dynamic changes in the top bar navigation confusing, especially when the "home" button moved depending on the page, suggesting a need for more consistent navigation cues.</li>
            <li>Homepage Length: A few testers mentioned that the homepage felt too long, potentially overwhelming users, although this was mitigated by the ability to access other sections easily.</li>
            <li>Improvements that have been implemented on the final website (or that would be implemented if doing so would be too complex):</li>
            <li>Consistent Navigation Bar: To address the confusion regarding the dynamic top bar, a fixed navigation bar with consistent options across all pages was implemented, ensuring that users can easily find and navigate to different sections of the website without ambiguity.</li>
            <li>Streamlined Homepage: The homepage was redesigned to condense content and reduce clutter, ensuring a more concise and user-friendly experience while still providing access to key information. This included clearer section headings, concise summaries, and prominent call-to-action buttons to direct users to relevant sections.</li>
          </ul>
