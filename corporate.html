          <h3>Persona</h3>
          <img src="images/persona.png" height="600" width="700" alt="persona">

          <p></p>

          <h3>Brand Name</h3>
          <p>The brand name “BetterPaw” consists of two words; ‘Better’ and ‘Paw’. 

 

            ‘Better’, is the word used for wanting your dog to get better, be better, and feel better. It’s the word used where the owner wants to grow together with their pet friend and connect with them and grow a stronger bond with. ‘Better’ is where you overcome the struggles that you and your dog have, in order to live, love, and strive for another day, one paw at a time. ‘Better’ is where not only a dog learns how to better themselves, but where the caregiver also gets taught how to regain control. 
            
             
            
            Whereas ‘Paw’ stands not only for the dog themself, but also lending a helping and loving hand. ‘Paw’ represents the joint efforts of both the owner, the dog, and the hardships they may have carried and continue to battle together. The word ‘Paw’ is about learning together, growing together, overcoming together. It’s a shared experience, where one cannot be without the other. ‘Paw’ is where love is a bond that is so strong that it can overcome anything through time and patience. 
            
             
            
            With this, we created “BetterPaw”, where we provide online training for rescue dogs and their beloved owners. </p>

          <h3>Visual identity</h3>
          <p>BetterPaw’s logo incorporates both the dog, and a human ‘paw’, the hand. This brings it back to the explanation of the brand name, in which we want to return to our values, most prominently love and patience. They’re crucial visions for both of us, dog owners, and their rescue dogs. When looking at our logo, we not only want it to be recognisable, but also a logo that people look at and immediately understand what we stand for.  
 
            The logo of BetterPaw is the base of every visual communication and will be put in every post that is put out, and it is important that we keep the colors of the logo the same as the colors of our palette, in addition to the font of the name, and if necessary, our slogan which is done with the Bilo font. </p>

          
          <p>Our use of icons is on the softer side. We use round corners, simplistic design and visuals, and keep it calm this way. Paws and bones are used in a playful way (a trail of paws, with the bones used as a complimentary design to accompany it), whereas our buttons are kept simple with purely rounded edges. The social media icons are all rounded and kept quite simple, in order not to overwhelm people. Most of our icon usage are the paws. We use these as dividers and complimentary design with the copy and imagery. </p>
          <p>As for our imagery, we want to capture the values of our brand. Such images have to demonstrate the importance, such as ‘Love’ showcasing the nurturing aspect of being a dog owner and the strong bond they have with their rescue dog. For ‘Patience’, the imagery should reflect the time and effort spent raising and training a dog and showing a supportive and most importantly a controlled environment. ‘Growth’ is an important imagery to capture the real-life situation that happens when being a dog owner, but being able to overcome obstacles together. And lastly, the imagery for ‘Community’ is most important of all, this should showcase the importance of being in a community and feeling understood. For this, BetterPaw uses a lifestyle photography in authentic settings, either at home or outside. The imagery should display the importance of our vision, values, and capture the spirit and energy of BetterPaw. We show real product interaction, positive environments, real life situations that reflect BetterPaw honestly, portray people in thriving and enjoyable situations, and people in bright and natural lighting. We do not show staged interactions or exaggerate effects/poses, nor do we use out-of-focus imagery. Overly conceptual imagery can be used, but in caution depending on what message BetterPaw wants to send. </p>
          <p>BetterPaw also makes great use of artistic visuals, as they are popular in terms of usage in our target group. These visuals showcase both dogs and dog owners, with a focus on the dogs. They are of simplistic design and do not take away from the importance at hand, our message and copy that comes with it. As BetterPaw uses a colorful palette alongside its funky font and core values, it is important that the brand showcases this through visuals as well. Digitally drawn and simple visuals are considered the best option for this. The feeling these visuals evoke are positive and should only be used when sending out a positive message. The visuals themselves should showcase this as well through smiles, playful behaviour, and overall happiness. </p>

          <h3>Copywriting</h3>
          <p>The tone of voice for BetterPaw is friendly and joyful, with a nurturing feel to it. We want others to feel and know that they are seen, understood, and heard. But the tone of voice also has the job of making people feel comfortable, both through our social media content and website alike. BetterPaw wants to tell a story that has personality, and that personality has to match with rescue dog owners. They have a different approach than regular dog owners even though they’re similar. The tone of voice is to be trusting and invite others to engage in a community. Where others say, “Rescue dogs are loving dogs”, we say “Sometimes your better half is on the other side of the world, and you only just realize it now.”. </p>

          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Colour scheme:</strong> Our colors consist of one main color and two secondary ones, besides using both black (#000000) and white (#ffffff). The main color is considered pink (#e63b7a), and the secondary colors are blue (#c3e7f1) and green (#26b56e). These colors are used throughout everything, from the logo to the fonts, imagery, icons, and artistic visuals. We want these colors to be vibrant yet approachable, so that BetterPaw gives off a positive feeling without it feeling manufactured.
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #E63B7A;"></span>
                 <strong>#E63B7A:</strong>  Pink is considered a popular color within our persona (think of “Millenial Pink” for example), and it also represents love, nurture and compassion. It evokes feelings of comfort, warmth and hope. This color is used in our logo and headings, but also important objects and subjects in order to draw the eye to it, such as a button to ‘Log In’ and ‘Giveaway’. As for background use, the color is only used in complement and to give diversity to the main background color, blue.
                  
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #C3E6F0;"></span>
                  <strong>#C3E6F0: </strong> Blue is one of the secondary colors that is mainly used as our official background color. There can be a slight hue to provide more depth, but green and pink should be the main consideration for complimentary design. Blue is represented as serenity, stability, inspiration, or wisdom. It can be a calming color, which is all in line with our vision of BetterPaw providing a sense of stability and control in the world. 
                 
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #00BD6E;"></span>
                  <strong>#00BD6E:</strong> Last but not least, we have our second secondary color, green. This color is used as a complimentary color to both our blue background and our main color, pink. It is often used in our artistic visuals and used to bring depth to our work. The colors represent rebirth and renewal, new beginnings, and growth. In addition to it also being considered youth, nature, and health. This fits in with BetterPaw’s values, especially (and quite literally), growth.
                 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li> <strong>Font choices:</strong> Two fonts are used, the BD Supper font and the Bilo font. Although the BD Supper font is big and loud, it’s still playful in the details. It attracts people but isn’t too serious with it, and it gives the feeling of “Yeah, this really looks like a dog-vibe font”. We use this font for our headings and logo. On the other hand, Bilo is the font we use for the informative text on both the website and social media posts, in addition to the slogan of the brand. This font is calm, collective, and easier to read, allowing the room to breathe. </li>
            
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>UI Patterns:</strong></li>
            <li>Testimonial: We tend to trust online reviews and testimonials as much as recommendations from people we know. Whether testimonials are presented with text, video, or include a picture of the sender’s face, they offer social proof giving your value claims more legitimacy.</li>
            <li>Navigation Tab: Navigation tabs provide a clear visual indication of what content can be found on a website and places the current location in context by highlighting it.</li>
            <li>Carousel (Used for Testimonials): The carousel highlights several different stories on the same screen. It allows users to quickly skim through stories. Carousels capture the user’s attention and retain attention with simple navigation. </li>
            <li>Footer: The hierarchical structure of a website can at times impede the path to specific page or function of a website. By adding a shortcut to the most frequently used pages and functions, the path can be shortened: the number of clicks can be lessened and the confusion decreased.</li>
            <li>Drop-Down Menu (Mobile): Drop-Down Menus save space, this is the main reason for using it.</li>

            <p></p>

            <li><strong>The structure of the navigation and content:</strong></li>
            <li>All these elements must be justified by referring to the theory <strong>and/or vocabulary</strong> of design</li>
            <li><Strong>Home Page:</Strong>The home page layout follows principles of visual hierarchy, with key information such as brand values and vision placed prominently using larger fonts, bold colours, and strategic positioning. Visual elements are carefully chosen to evoke emotions of warmth, love, and compassion, aligning with the brand's identity.

Through compelling messaging and engaging visuals, the page highlights the benefits of the brand's products and services, encouraging users to explore further.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Community Page:</strong>The layout of the community page is designed with user engagement in mind, featuring clear call-to-action buttons, intuitive navigation, and visually appealing community features.

Users feel valued and understood, strengthening their connection to the brand and increasing the likelihood of repeat interactions and conversions.</li>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>We have created a Marketing Campaign within the context of our brand and its website, “BetterPaw”, whose target audience is represented by dog owners, in particular single and working women aged between 28 and 35 years. We aimed to promote our brand, brand values and the product we offer through our website, online training plans for dogs, more specifically for rescued dogs, whose problems are more distinct, their issues involving past trauma, anxiety, and antisociality towards the owner, other people and dogs. We have used various popular social media platforms among our target audience, such as Instagram (posts, stories, reels), TikTok, and Facebook, in order to promote the multiple benefits our brand has to offer.</p>
          
          <h5>Objectives</h5>
          <p>For our marketing campaign we have set certain objectives per platform, per every week. </p>

          <p>Connection to Objectives: Establishing a dedicated Facebook group for BetterPaw's community facilitates deeper engagement, sharing of resources, and discussions, aligning with our objectives of creating positive emotions and encouraging active interaction with our brand.</p>


          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>Multiple things were learned by all the team members during the project. Although we had prior knowledge of what a marketing plan exactly enfolds due to past projects, some areas were still quite new to us, including the execution of our campaign. For starters, we learned how to do proper research in order to know our schedule for posting social media content. Considering our plan was to use Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook (As these are heavily used platforms by our target audience), we had to ensure that our objectives would be met. With this in mind, we divided roles in which team member tackles what platform and what content. We learned that there are various responses to our questions (“What is the best time to post”, “Which day has more engagements”, “Which hashtags gives us our biggest reach”, “What type of content works best for our audience”), and thus created a schedule with different times and content. We learned how to set up a professional account on aforementioned platforms, and also (somehow) learned how to get banned multiple times in a row on Instagram. We didn’t learn how to get unbanned however, clearly. Our final and successful account was created with a new Gmail account that was specifically catered towards a business account that is not connected to any of our personal ones. Did this do the trick? Perhaps. It’s still questionable at best for one of our team members being forced to take photos of his face from every angle for Instagram. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Moving on from this fiasco, we immediately learned a new thing: how to work under stress and how to revise a content calendar. We noticed and learned almost immediately that Facebook gave us the worst engagement, whereas Instagram was more dependent on our followers, and TikTok on their algorithm. Although we continued with Facebook, we gave it the least amount of attention out of the three and put more focus into pumping out content for Instagram and TikTok. We learned a little bit of what type of posts do better on TikTok (Using CapCut to make edits, hopping on to trendy sounds/memes, relatable content and captions), and got a better understanding of Instagram posts that did (and did not) do well, in which Reels, regardless of whether they were made specifically for Instagram (exclusive content) or copy-pasted from TikTok, didn’t do so well, whereas visual-heavy posts did a lot better in terms of engagement. TikTok posts, as expected, did very well when it came to following trends and using popular music, which validates the research that was done (which we also learned from). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On a more detailed (yet also a bit negative) note, we also noticed that our engagement eventually lessened the more we posted on Instagram. We tried various approaches such as posting at different times, posting more within a day, and different hashtags. Not much changed, resulting in a lack of learning as to what we could do to improve it. One ‘trend’ we did notice was that we got (slightly) more engagement when imagery of dogs was used, big on the post as well. Considering we found out during our research that posts that focus more on the dog than dog owner does better, the results are understandable. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Whether a post on Instagram had multiple photos or not did not seem to matter in better engagement, nor did the number of hashtags. We did not stray away from making posts that contained proper branding of ‘BetterPaw’, as we did not want to create confusion or give off a chaotic ‘vibe’ when that is the exact opposite of what our brand is about. We tried to make users engage with us through commenting on both Instagram posts and Instagram Story, but neither resulted into anything, unless you count bots, then we had a few. We were unsure how else to gain engagement in such a way, so we ended up letting it be as it is, as we were quite stumped. We used call-to-action(s) on our posts, and our stories had both a sticker to answer our questions and polls, the call-to-action(s) and sticker didn’t give us much, but the polls did decently compared to those. We figured that due to the current state of the attention span of people that they prefer simplistic, ‘no-brainer’ activities, which can be a poll. However, due to stories being very limited to mostly followers-only we did not continue with this and moved on to hitting our objectives. We also tried to post our videos from TikTok over to Instagram but noticed that it gave us low engagement rates. We did some research for this and figured out that Instagram deliberately does not push videos not made in Instagram (or using their library of songs) into their algorithm. After realising this we quickly stopped and moved on. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>At first, we did reach our objectives for Instagram very quickly. But as explained, as time went on our engagement became less consistent and lower. With this, we’re not quite sure if we did really reach our objective. Had we perhaps ventured out more with our content, then we could have maybe kept it more consistent and maybe even have gotten higher engagement. We took a gamble, and on advice from our teacher we only tried to pump out as much as possible with different styles in our last week of tracking. It’s difficult to get information from this as it’s not the same volume of posts as our on-brand posts that we’ve posted. Moreover, looking at what we did post the engagement rate did not seem to get particularly better by any means. At least we quickly reached the objective of “50 followers” by promoting our brand through our personal accounts (and a few posts along the way, though some of them were bots which we removed, it was inauthentic to our objective and a bit like cheating). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On TikTok, we originally started out with content made from scratch that lasted to about 20-30 seconds each, but we quickly took notice that such a thing didn’t work out for engagement ratings or the algorithm. The best way was for it to be the shorter the better and playing in on the trends/memes in order to get the most out of our video. We tried to get a better understanding of the algorithm that TikTok uses, but sadly didn’t get very far except for what was just mentioned. We ended up ignoring our plan to stick to our branding, and have some fun with it, while trying to maintain the posting schedule time. This worked out a lot better and we got some videos that did a lot better than others. These were the ones that made use of meme templates and trendy sounds. An exception to this was a sad post about rescue dogs/puppies, which made us realize that playing in on people’s emotions, especially ones that garner a high amount of empathy (or sadness, depending on how you see it), works really well. We didn’t continue with this approach due to the fact that it did not fully fit with the branding of ‘BetterPaw’, which is supposed to have more happy and easily digestible content. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>We quickly realised that TikTok ended up being a platform more used to have fun, following trends and trying to be relatable to our target audience than keeping up our brand and appearance, showcasing what is most important about ‘BetterPaw’. Although this absolutely helped for our engagement and mostly reaching (and, in some ways, surpassing!) our objectives (we did not reach 200 views per video, but the ones that did get more than 200 exceeded our expectations three- up to elevenfold), it is uncertain as to whether this would have helped gaining traffic to our website, due the campaign being a student project with no live website, and thus having no insight available for traffic-related engagement. However, our tactics ended up changing to the aforementioned realisation due to it not sticking, had we continued with our original tactic we likely would not have ended up reaching our objective/goal for TikTok, or at least not in the way we currently did. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Facebook was a mess. Consider it a lost cause, really. We very, very quickly noticed that Facebook was a deserted platform, and incredibly difficult to get a proper following or any type of engagement that’s not coming from your own parents when you’re a no-name brand. We originally tried to make exclusive content that you wouldn’t see on TikTok or Instagram, but it didn’t work. We then tried to use content put on Instagram originally, also didn’t work. We kept trying, seeing if something, anything would change and that we could get some engagement, but up until the end it was practically nothing. We ended up realising (and learning…) that Facebook is a terrible place to promote on, and even though it’s still heavily used within our target audience, it’s not for brands. These people come to Facebook for friends and family, not to see their “favourite” dog brand struggling. Maybe once we become an established, household name brand will we try on Facebook again, but until then, we’re good. It’s clear to say that we did not reach our objective for Facebook. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It might have been naïve, but our expectations were really just to meet our objectives/goals for all of our platforms. Although we weren’t very positive about it, due to being reminded that it’s still a student project at the end of the day, we aimed to reach them anyway. We figured that we kind of overshot Facebook, due to none of the team members being very active on the platform itself, and the research done for those particular objectives were questionable at best. What we didn’t expect were, besides Facebook, mostly positives. We absolutely did not expect some of our TikTok videos to get high views, exceeding and smashing our objectives, or that followers for both Instagram and TikTok would be so quick to reach. The engagement rate dropping like flies for Instagram was a bit of a let down as well, it shows we don’t have a proper grasp of the algorithm just yet. What we absolutely did not expect was the ban of our accounts on Instagram. It took us by surprise and left us with less time to track our campaign and we had to change a few things around, such as the schedule and objectives to make them more realistic. And frankly, we didn’t expect Instagram to drop off with engagement towards the end. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It’s clear that we need to do even more research regarding this, to avoid and otherwise know how to handle these situations. There’s quite a few things that, now with this knowledge in mind, could’ve either been researched more in depth or gone differently. Algorithms of both Instagram and TikTok could’ve been researched more properly, to ensure we can keep a consistent level of engagement. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Although we tried our best, it was clear that it wasn’t enough. Taking trends into account should have been a ‘thing’ from the get-go for TikTok (and perhaps Instagram), this could have given us a boost from the start and perhaps have made us hit our objective faster (and completely). Experimenting with a lack of hashtags and perhaps unrelatable (to our brand) hashtags is something we should have tried to give us even more insights to go off on to realize what the best approach to engagement is. One thing we didn’t try, but could have for the same reason as just given, is commenting on others people’s videos, and making use of the ‘repost’ feature on TikTok. Perhaps this would have boosted us as well. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As for Instagram, something that we most definitely could have done different is trying out new styles and also experimenting more. We were a bit stubborn in the fact that, originally, our formula for engagement seemed to work. Although we tried some stuff out here and there (Reposting TikTok videos, exclusive content), as mentioned plenty of times now, it still dropped. We only started experimenting slightly in the last week after having received feedback. Experimenting with hashtags, captions, and types of content is also definitely something worth checking out, whether it’s to confirm our research or to debunk it. The same goes for going off-brand with our Instagram posts. We were very attached to our brand identity for the sake of our company and making things recognizable and less chaotic, but perhaps this was the wrong approach. If we were to shake things up, then maybe engagement could have been consistently higher. And lastly, even though we were already sort of experimenting with it, we could have tried out posting at random times more. It would, again, be for the same aforementioned reasonings, but we didn’t try it enough. For example, posting at 3 A.M. was, oddly enough according to our research, an option for engagement but we did not try it due to abductive reasoning (“It’s 3 A.M., be serious.”). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As for Facebook… Perhaps it would have been best not to try it at all. Looking at the accounts of other teams we noticed the same pattern and problem. It all sounds nice on paper, but the execution was by far the worst one. Trying a different platform, such as X, Youtube, or even Threads could have possibly been a better option. So even though Facebook is the most used platform, especially for our target audience, it doesn’t necessarily have to be the right one. And if we would be forced to use Facebook, then we should do way more in-depth research, perhaps comment more, join Facebook groups, post a lot more than we originally did. Anything really, to try and get engagement up. All in all, this has been a great learning experience for all of us.</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
         
         
          <p>In the future, be it a few weeks or months from now, we have a few ideas on how we would tackle the future marketing strategy for BetterPaw. Since TikTok was our most successful platform we would probably continue with what we are doing. The content we would post would be less than 20 seconds to keep people’s attention. We would also have to stay up to date with the newest trends on TikTok, whether that be the most used songs or challenges to name a few, and try to make posts that follow those concepts as fast as possible as so not to miss out on it. These posts would also have our identity within them. By this, we mean a catchy song or popular challenge with dogs involved. And these posts would also have to be relatable to the audience watching. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Additionally, for Instagram, we would have to retreat and change our strategy. The first step would be to analyze the last content we pumped out to see if any of them gained traction. If one or more did, we will check to see what aspect of it is different than the previous posts that did not do so well. We would have a trial run where we would make two or more experimental posts in that week to see if they also get more attention.  And the week after that, we would make two control posts with the old type of content. Then when both results are in we would either go forward with the new type of experimental post (because they got more interactions/views) or we would pivot and go back to the drawing board and start from scratch with more desk research (comparing our Instagram post with more popular brands) and field research (asking people who fit our target audience what makes them interact with an Instagram post). Alternatively, if the most recent content pump also doesn’t yield a successful amount of interaction then we would have to either try complete new forms of post and/or immediately start doing desk- and field research. In this phase, we will do more short attention-friendly content such as polls, posting at different times (yes, even 3 A.M.), and collaborating with other creators, specifically BetterPaw customers. An example of this could be: customers would be able to go live on Instagram to talk to Dog trainers and experts for extra tips and tricks for their rescue dogs and possible collaborations with companies that produce dog products such as toys and materials (think bowls and leashes etc…) </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>And lastly Facebook, our most unsuccessful marketing platform.  We think that the most important aspect would be to have our website up and running at full functionality (hypothetically of course). We would leave Facebook, as in not making any posts for a minimum of one month (since that’s how long the training plan is for) before coming back to begin again. This would be after we have a few customers who are part of the community and using the training plan. We would make posts about the testimonials of our customers and their rescue dogs. We would also have posts about tips and tricks on how to deal with your rescue dogs and possibly pictures of dog owners during their personalized behavior training. Moreover, we would have all these posts with something saying; “Want to know more/ Want to get more tips/training. Join our community on BetterPaw!” to generate more traffic to our website. We would then take a week to analyze the amount of people who have seen and interacted with our posts and go from there. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>So to say we have a few ideas on how we can proceed in the future in regard to the marketing on these platforms. We will see what works now and continue with those and for what doesn’t work now we will apply the aforementioned alternatives. If even those fall through we will step back and come up with some alternatives for the alternatives and so on. </p>

          </ul>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The BetterPaw website is the product itself. The behavior analysis test and training along with personal help from experts are the services that are offered. </li>
            <li>BetterPaw hosts a community of people who want to have people around them with the same challenges; having and trying to train a rescue dog. </li>
            <li>BetterPaw also empowers dog owners by letting them have the knowledge and taking their dog’s training in their hands. </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>We decided that the website would be focused on the following aspects: giving rescue dog owners the space to train their dogs when it is more convenient for them and fostering a helpful and supportive community. This was decided based on all the interviews that were done with the target audience. These dog owners had rescue dogs who could not get the training that they needed from the standard puppy school in their vicinity. The fixed training that was given at these schools was not something they could fit in their busy schedules, or their lessons could not be applied to their rescue dogs as opposed to other dogs, due to their difficulties such as anxiety and trauma. 

The product that BetterPaw offers its customers is the Behavioral Assessment Test where the customers get a personalized training plan for their pet for €40 (which is the estimated average price the target audience agreed on). The service hereby is the opportunity to talk to a coach and expert in the weekly check-in sessions that the customers can plan whenever they want. Additionally, customers can share their advice and tips with each other and the website which is the community aspect. 

This choice was ultimately made because the target audience expressed their desire to have (tailored) training for their rescue dogs and have more people who also had the same issues as they did around them. Moreover, this online schedule offers them freedom that is not available in traditional schools. </p>
