          <h3>Persona</h3>
          <img src="images/persona.png" height="600" width="700" alt="persona">

          <p></p>

          <h3>Brand Name</h3>
          <p>The brand name “BetterPaw” consists of two words; ‘Better’ and ‘Paw’. 

 

            ‘Better’, is the word used for wanting your dog to get better, be better, and feel better. It’s the word used where the owner wants to grow together with their pet friend and connect with them and grow a stronger bond with. ‘Better’ is where you overcome the struggles that you and your dog have, in order to live, love, and strive for another day, one paw at a time. ‘Better’ is where not only a dog learns how to better themselves, but where the caregiver also gets taught how to regain control. 
            
             
            
            Whereas ‘Paw’ stands not only for the dog themself, but also lending a helping and loving hand. ‘Paw’ represents the joint efforts of both the owner, the dog, and the hardships they may have carried and continue to battle together. The word ‘Paw’ is about learning together, growing together, overcoming together. It’s a shared experience, where one cannot be without the other. ‘Paw’ is where love is a bond that is so strong that it can overcome anything through time and patience. 
            
             
            
            With this, we created “BetterPaw”, where we provide online training for rescue dogs and their beloved owners. </p>

          <h3>Visual identity</h3>
          <p>BetterPaw’s logo incorporates both the dog, and a human ‘paw’, the hand. This brings it back to the explanation of the brand name, in which we want to return to our values, most prominently love and patience. They’re crucial visions for both of us, dog owners, and their rescue dogs. When looking at our logo, we not only want it to be recognisable, but also a logo that people look at and immediately understand what we stand for.  
 
            The logo of BetterPaw is the base of every visual communication and will be put in every post that is put out, and it is important that we keep the colors of the logo the same as the colors of our palette, in addition to the font of the name, and if necessary, our slogan which is done with the Bilo font. </p>

          
          <p>Our use of icons is on the softer side. We use round corners, simplistic design and visuals, and keep it calm this way. Paws and bones are used in a playful way (a trail of paws, with the bones used as a complimentary design to accompany it), whereas our buttons are kept simple with purely rounded edges. The social media icons are all rounded and kept quite simple, in order not to overwhelm people. Most of our icon usage are the paws. We use these as dividers and complimentary design with the copy and imagery. </p>
          <p>As for our imagery, we want to capture the values of our brand. Such images have to demonstrate the importance, such as ‘Love’ showcasing the nurturing aspect of being a dog owner and the strong bond they have with their rescue dog. For ‘Patience’, the imagery should reflect the time and effort spent raising and training a dog and showing a supportive and most importantly a controlled environment. ‘Growth’ is an important imagery to capture the real-life situation that happens when being a dog owner, but being able to overcome obstacles together. And lastly, the imagery for ‘Community’ is most important of all, this should showcase the importance of being in a community and feeling understood. For this, BetterPaw uses a lifestyle photography in authentic settings, either at home or outside. The imagery should display the importance of our vision, values, and capture the spirit and energy of BetterPaw. We show real product interaction, positive environments, real life situations that reflect BetterPaw honestly, portray people in thriving and enjoyable situations, and people in bright and natural lighting. We do not show staged interactions or exaggerate effects/poses, nor do we use out-of-focus imagery. Overly conceptual imagery can be used, but in caution depending on what message BetterPaw wants to send. </p>
          <p>BetterPaw also makes great use of artistic visuals, as they are popular in terms of usage in our target group. These visuals showcase both dogs and dog owners, with a focus on the dogs. They are of simplistic design and do not take away from the importance at hand, our message and copy that comes with it. As BetterPaw uses a colorful palette alongside its funky font and core values, it is important that the brand showcases this through visuals as well. Digitally drawn and simple visuals are considered the best option for this. The feeling these visuals evoke are positive and should only be used when sending out a positive message. The visuals themselves should showcase this as well through smiles, playful behaviour, and overall happiness. </p>

          <h3>Copywriting</h3>
          <p>The tone of voice for BetterPaw is friendly and joyful, with a nurturing feel to it. We want others to feel and know that they are seen, understood, and heard. But the tone of voice also has the job of making people feel comfortable, both through our social media content and website alike. BetterPaw wants to tell a story that has personality, and that personality has to match with rescue dog owners. They have a different approach than regular dog owners even though they’re similar. The tone of voice is to be trusting and invite others to engage in a community. Where others say, “Rescue dogs are loving dogs”, we say “Sometimes your better half is on the other side of the world, and you only just realize it now.”. </p>

          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Colour scheme:</strong> Our colors consist of one main color and two secondary ones, besides using both black (#000000) and white (#ffffff). The main color is considered pink (#e63b7a), and the secondary colors are blue (#c3e7f1) and green (#26b56e). These colors are used throughout everything, from the logo to the fonts, imagery, icons, and artistic visuals. We want these colors to be vibrant yet approachable, so that BetterPaw gives off a positive feeling without it feeling manufactured.
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #E63B7A;"></span>
                 <strong>#E63B7A:</strong>  Pink is considered a popular color within our persona (think of “Millenial Pink” for example), and it also represents love, nurture and compassion. It evokes feelings of comfort, warmth and hope. This color is used in our logo and headings, but also important objects and subjects in order to draw the eye to it, such as a button to ‘Log In’ and ‘Giveaway’. As for background use, the color is only used in complement and to give diversity to the main background color, blue.
                  
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #C3E6F0;"></span>
                  <strong>#C3E6F0: </strong> Blue is one of the secondary colors that is mainly used as our official background color. There can be a slight hue to provide more depth, but green and pink should be the main consideration for complimentary design. Blue is represented as serenity, stability, inspiration, or wisdom. It can be a calming color, which is all in line with our vision of BetterPaw providing a sense of stability and control in the world. 
                 
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #00BD6E;"></span>
                  <strong>#00BD6E:</strong> Last but not least, we have our second secondary color, green. This color is used as a complimentary color to both our blue background and our main color, pink. It is often used in our artistic visuals and used to bring depth to our work. The colors represent rebirth and renewal, new beginnings, and growth. In addition to it also being considered youth, nature, and health. This fits in with BetterPaw’s values, especially (and quite literally), growth.
                 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li> <strong>Font choices:</strong> Two fonts are used, the BD Supper font and the Bilo font. Although the BD Supper font is big and loud, it’s still playful in the details. It attracts people but isn’t too serious with it, and it gives the feeling of “Yeah, this really looks like a dog-vibe font”. We use this font for our headings and logo. On the other hand, Bilo is the font we use for the informative text on both the website and social media posts, in addition to the slogan of the brand. This font is calm, collective, and easier to read, allowing the room to breathe. </li>
            
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>UI Patterns:</strong></li>
            <li>Testimonial: We tend to trust online reviews and testimonials as much as recommendations from people we know. Whether testimonials are presented with text, video, or include a picture of the sender’s face, they offer social proof giving your value claims more legitimacy.</li>
            <li>Navigation Tab: Navigation tabs provide a clear visual indication of what content can be found on a website and places the current location in context by highlighting it.</li>
            <li>Carousel (Used for Testimonials): The carousel highlights several different stories on the same screen. It allows users to quickly skim through stories. Carousels capture the user’s attention and retain attention with simple navigation. </li>
            <li>Footer: The hierarchical structure of a website can at times impede the path to specific page or function of a website. By adding a shortcut to the most frequently used pages and functions, the path can be shortened: the number of clicks can be lessened and the confusion decreased.</li>
            <li>Drop-Down Menu (Mobile): Drop-Down Menus save space, this is the main reason for using it.</li>

            <p></p>

            <li><strong>The structure of the navigation and content:</strong></li>
            <li>All these elements must be justified by referring to the theory <strong>and/or vocabulary</strong> of design</li>
            <li><Strong>Home Page:</Strong>The home page layout follows principles of visual hierarchy, with key information such as brand values and vision placed prominently using larger fonts, bold colours, and strategic positioning. Visual elements are carefully chosen to evoke emotions of warmth, love, and compassion, aligning with the brand's identity. The design elements, including colour palette, imagery, and typography, are selected to reflect the brand's values and personality.

The home page serves as a focal point for communicating BetterPaw's unique value proposition to visitors. Through compelling messaging and engaging visuals, the page highlights the benefits of the brand's products and services, encouraging users to explore further.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Community Page:</strong>The layout of the community page is designed with user engagement in mind, featuring clear call-to-action buttons, intuitive navigation, and visually appealing community features.

By providing a platform for users to connect and support each other, the community page contributes to building brand loyalty and advocacy. Through user-generated content and peer interactions, the page reinforces the brand's positioning as a trusted resource for rescue dog owners.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Your Profile Page:</strong>The layout of the profile page prioritizes personalized content and usability, making it easy for users to access and manage their profile information. Design elements are tailored to enhance the user experience, with intuitive navigation and clear organization of user-specific content.

By offering a personalized user experience, the profile page enhances user engagement and retention. Users feel valued and understood, strengthening their connection to the brand and increasing the likelihood of repeat interactions and conversions.</li>

            <li>Streamlined Homepage: The homepage should be redesigned to condense content and reduce clutter, ensuring a more concise and user-friendly experience while still providing access to key information.

            <li>Clarifying Page Names: Rename ambiguous page names to provide clearer labels that accurately convey the purpose and content of each page, reducing user confusion.</li>
          
            <li>Navigation Bar Drop-Down Button for Mobile: Adjust the Drop-Down button for the navigation bar on mobile so users can always navigate the pages of the website and do not have to scroll all the way up to the beginning of the page, for a better user experience.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This is our 3rd Lean Canvas, the final version.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Training Challenges: </strong>Users find it hard to find time to take their dogs to school and standard training </li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Support:</strong>Dog owners feel like there aren’t people they can ask for advice and tips about the issues they have while trying to train their dogs. </li>
            <li><strong>Behavioural Issues:</strong>Because these dogs are rescues, they often have behavioural issues.</li>
            
            <li>Describe briefly how the problems are solved now (existing alternatives).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The BetterPaw website is the product itself. The behavior analysis test and training along with personal help from experts are the services that are offered. </li>
            <li>BetterPaw hosts a community of people who want to have people around them with the same challenges; having and trying to train a rescue dog. </li>
            <li>BetterPaw also empowers dog owners by letting them have the knowledge and taking their dog’s training in their hands. </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>We decided that the website would be focused on the following aspects: giving rescue dog owners the space to train their dogs when it is more convenient for them and fostering a helpful and supportive community. This was decided based on all the interviews that were done with the target audience. These dog owners had rescue dogs who could not get the training that they needed from the standard puppy school in their vicinity. The fixed training that was given at these schools was not something they could fit in their busy schedules, or their lessons could not be applied to their rescue dogs as opposed to other dogs, due to their difficulties such as anxiety and trauma. 

The product that BetterPaw offers its customers is the Behavioral Assessment Test where the customers get a personalized training plan for their pet for €40 (which is the estimated average price the target audience agreed on). The service hereby is the opportunity to talk to a coach and expert in the weekly check-in sessions that the customers can plan whenever they want. Additionally, customers can share their advice and tips with each other and the website which is the community aspect. 

This choice was ultimately made because the target audience expressed their desire to have (tailored) training for their rescue dogs and have more people who also had the same issues as they did around them. Moreover, this online schedule offers them freedom that is not available in traditional schools. </p>
